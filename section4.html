            <h2>Versatile Developer</h2>
            <p>I am born in Kavadarci in 2003. I graduated from Primary School and High School with highest marks, with a special affinity for mathematics and computer science.
                I am currently successfully studying at the Faculty of Information Sciences and Computer Engineering in Skopje.
                I have worked on several projects in this area. The field of databases and aesthetic development of sites and applications is my main focus and
                passion. The main principles that I want to be guided by are dedication and consistency.</p>
