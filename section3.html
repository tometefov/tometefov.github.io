                    <h2>Sharing is caring!</h2>
                    <p>How many times have you wanted to go to your favorite destination, not knowing that your neighbor,
                        or even a fellow citizen, has the same intention, and you spent twice as much on gas and tolls, instead of going together in the same car?
                        <br>I've developed the 'Delly' app that locates people with similar interests for travelling and connects them with the intention of alleviating their costs!</p>

                    <h1>Food Delivery App</h1>
                    <h2>Instant and quality delivery of food and goods</h2>
                    <p>My town was missing a food delivery app. Only a few restaurants had delivery available,
                        all the rest did not. Together with another friend, we've developed a web application 'pet-min-delivery.mk' that was
                        joined by several restaurants from our city and worked on the principle: you order food items through the app,
                        you leave an address, then the delivery person pays for them and delivers them to your address.
                        It sounds simple, because the city is not very big after all.</p>
